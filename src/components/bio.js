			Coming from a family of artists, I fell in love with web design due to its ability to mesh creativity with interactivity and user experience. I geek out on cool new CSS tricks and animations. I am constantly striving to learn new languages, libraries, and logic to create the ideal web experience.

            Outside of coding, you can find me on the ultimate frisbee field throwing a disc, working on my bike, or getting yeast to play nicely with teas and grains (kombucha and beer).  I strive to bring positivity and community into all things I do.
